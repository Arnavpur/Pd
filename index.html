                <p>
                    Though miles may keep us far, my love stays near,  
                    And years between us matter not to me.  
                    No gap in time can shake what we hold dear,  
                    My heart is yours, as strong as love can be.  
                    <br><br>
                    I promise I will grow and do my best,  
                    To be the man you need through every day.  
                    Though younger now, I'll rise to meet the test,  
                    And prove my love in all I do and say.  
                    <br><br>
                    I'll cherish you in laughter and in tears,  
                    Through every joy and sorrow we will share.  
                    No matter what, through all the coming years,  
                    I'll stand by you with love beyond compare.  
                    <br><br>
                    So trust in me, though distance fills the space,  
                    One day, my love, I'll hold you in embrace.  
                </p>
